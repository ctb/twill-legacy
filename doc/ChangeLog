2005-11-15  Titus Brown  <t@issola.caltech.edu>

	* Cleared content-type header in wwwsearch.zip, urllib2_support.py,
	  class HTTPRedirectHandler, redirect_request.  This fixes a bug
	  I noticed when testing collar: redirects inappropriately retain
	  content-type, and this breaks Quixote, at the least, when
	  enctype multipart/form-data is used in a POST prior to the
	  redirect.  (CTB: this should be dealt with more generally.)

	* Fixed back() behavior in _mechanize.  (I probably broke it in the
	  first place, sigh.)  Now accords with latest trunk _mechanize.py.

	* Fixed order of __url__ setting in parse.execute_command.

	* Added 'debug twill' to set printout of twill commands as they
	  are executed.

	* Attempted to add http_auth testing, but failed.  (non-functional
	  code left in test/)

	* Overrode 'view_html' bool function in PatchedMechanizeBrowser.
	  It now assumes that no content-type means text/html, and also
	  allows 'text/xml' to be used.  (James Cameron's issue.)

	* moved _TwillBrowserState into browser.py, named it TwillBrowser().

	* twill-sh now prints out the exception str when executing files,
	  even when 'fail' flag is not set.

	  something ;).

	  dictionaries.

	* Now checks for exact matches to fieldnames before trying out
	  regexps.

	* Submit w/o submit buttons now working.

	* Fixed quoted handling of __stuff__.

	* More intelligent pyparsing stuff from Paul McGuire; in particular,
	  comments on the ends of lines are allowed, and '#' in arguments
	  is disallowed.

	  pyparsing code.

	  only prepending 'http://' when it's tried other URLs first.  Added
	  test.

	  value of submit buttons on form submission.  Added tests for the
