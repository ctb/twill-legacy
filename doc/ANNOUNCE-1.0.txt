ANNOUNCING retwill v1.0.

twill is a simple language for browsing the Web.  It's designed for
automated testing of Web sites, but it can be used to interact with
Web sites in a variety of ways.  In particular, twill supports form
submission, cookies, redirects, and HTTP authentication. retwill, for
its turn, is a fork of twill. This documents describes the fist version
of retwill.


A retwill script to use the "I'm feeling lucky" button on Google looks
like this:

    setlocal query "twill Python"

    go http://www.google.com/

    fv 1 q $query
    submit btnI     # use the "I'm feeling lucky" button

    show

(Note that using this script abuses Google's Terms of Service.  So don't.)

You can install the latest release of retwill with easy_install,

    easy_install retwill

pip,

    pip install retwill

or download this release at

    http://bitbucket.org/brandizzi/retwill

Documentation for twill is included in the package and is also online at

    http://twill.idyll.org/

Documentation specific to retwill is going to be prepared.

Miscellaneous details:

twill/retwill is implemented in Python and uses pyparsing and mechanize.  In
addition to the existing simple command language, retwill can easily be
extended with Python.  retwill also provides a fairly simple and
well-documented wrapper around mechanize.

As well as twill, retwill does not understand JavaScript, I'm sorry to say.

Significant changes with 1.0

  * Non string values can be used in dollar expressions. Thus, the previously
    invalid code below will execute and output "6":

        run 'i = 3'
        echo ${i+3}

    (Before that you would need to write "${str(i+3)}.)

    * find/notfind supports XPath. For using this feature, just pass the "x"
      flag to find/notfind:

        go http://www.pudim.com.br
        find "//div[@id='SiteBuilder_Conteudo']" x

    * Using Python's logging module. It allowed us to add new useful command
      line arguments:

        --loglevel / -l
            allows the user to set the log level to one of the default Python
            logging module levels: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, 
            or NOTSET

        --logfile / -L
            allows the user to redirect the log output to a file, or discard
            the output if the passed name is 'none'. (If you want to send the
            output to a file named 'none', just precede it by the representaton
            of the current directory: --logfile=./none)

        --output / -o
            allows the user to redirect the script output to a file, or discard
            the output if the passed name is 'none'. (If you want to send the
            output to a file named 'none', just precede it by the representaton
            of the current directory: --logfile=./none)

    * Now you can choose the tidy command to be ran through the --tidy / -t
      command line option. E.g.:
      
          $ twill-sh --tidy="$HOME/bin/tidy-html5 -config my.conf" test.twill
