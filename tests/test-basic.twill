#### This is a script designed to test basic functionality for most of
#### the commands in twill.  The only things not tested are the commands
#### that only print stuff out, and:
####
#### add_auth, extend_with, runfile, setglobal/setlocal interaction
#### also, be sure to test $/__ interpolation.
